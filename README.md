# Magic-8-Ball

It's in Python but maybe since I named the source code file main.cpp, it says it's in C++. 

The Magic 8 Ball is a entertainment device/toy that has many responses to questions asked about the person using it. Usually, the responses should be random so it is just a fun way to answer questions or perhaps testing fate. The physical item usually would have the user ask a question and then, they would shake the item to reveal the response that would answer that question or ask them to try it again!
