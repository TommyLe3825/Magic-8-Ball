# Magic-8-Ball

The Magic 8 Ball is an entertainment device/toy that has many responses to questions asked about the person using it. Usually, the responses should be random so it is just a fun way to answer questions or perhaps testing fate. The physical item usually would have the user ask a question and then, they would shake the item to reveal the response that would answer that question or ask them to try it again!
